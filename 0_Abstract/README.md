# LED Blink

## ABSTRACT

### This is basically a project made with ATMEGA 328P microcontroller being the the brain of the whole system.
### The Controller takes the input from one of its ports and a particular timing have been assigned so that the pin goes high and low accordingly.
### The pin on the other end is connected with 5 LEDs in parallel to each other with the resistance in between to prevent the damage.
### As the pin goes high , the LEDs turn on and after a particular duration they turn off all at once. 
### This program continues without end, as embedded programs are designed in such a way.
